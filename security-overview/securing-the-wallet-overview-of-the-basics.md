# Securing the wallet - Overview of the basics

### **There are two security mechanisms that prevent you from accidental loss or theft of your Bitcoin:**

1. Seed Backup recovery codes
2. Wallet passphrases

#### **If you lose your computer or wallet file**

* The Seed Backup allows you to recover your Bitcoin wallets
* &#x20;Your Passphrase allows you to unlock the recovered Bitcoin wallets

Both the Seed Backup and the Passphrase are required to recover a lost wallet. **If you lose the Seed Backup OR the Passphrase, you will not be able to recover access to your Bitcoin if you lose your computer.**
